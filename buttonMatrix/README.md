# CircuitPython ButtonMatrix

A matrix of buttons are each connected to a unique pair of "send" and "receive" pins, allowing (for example) the use of six buttons with the five GPIO pins of the Trinket M0.

The ButtonMatrix object gives shared callbacks for keyDownCallback, keyUpCallback, keyHoldCallback, and each button can be initialized with its own callbacks.

Work in progress, more documentation to come.
